We are introducing a new category in addition to "plugins" and "blueprints": "patches".

Simple fixes or changes that don't require a full plugin extension or feature can now be shared via the Cloudify patches repo.

First example patch is to supprt accessing lists from the [cloudify deployment proxy](https://github.com/cloudify-examples/cloudify-proxy-plugin).
